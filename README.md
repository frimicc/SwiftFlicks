# SwiftFlicks

This is a more modern version of "Flicks", written in Swift instead of Objective-C and using Alamofire networking. 
It still uses [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to get information about movies.

## Features

* Shows "Now Playing" movies on startup.
* Tap any movie to see the description. 
* Pull down to reveal the search box. Search for any string you like.

## Future Features

If I had time, I'd fix/add the following, but I needed to get something working in about 4 hours. 

* Better animations.
* More detailed information on both the list and detail views.
* Paging. Currently only the first page of results, up to 20 items, is shown.
